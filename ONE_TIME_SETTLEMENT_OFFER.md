**Re:** One-Time Good Faith Settlement Offer — Complete Resolution of All Three Claims
Policy No. 608037503-203-1
Claims: JFK4192 (Mercedes), JCM4246001 (Prius), JHV3227 (BMW)
Insured: Aleksandra Khizver & Iosif Khizver

---

## SECTION I: PURPOSE AND NATURE OF THIS OFFER

This letter constitutes a **one-time, good faith settlement offer** to resolve all three outstanding claims under the above-referenced policy in a single transaction. The purpose is to avoid the cost, delay, and burden of formal litigation for both parties.

This offer is extended despite Travelers' documented pattern of statutory violations, misrepresentations, and bad faith conduct detailed below. It represents a significant concession by the Khizver family and is made in the spirit of efficiency and finality — not because the claims lack merit, but because the family seeks resolution over prolonged conflict.

**This offer expires at 5:00 PM Pacific Time on Wednesday, February 12, 2026.** If Travelers does not accept or meaningfully respond by that deadline, this offer is withdrawn permanently, and the Khizver family will pursue all available legal remedies, including but not limited to bad faith litigation, elder abuse claims, punitive damages, and regulatory complaints.

---

## SECTION II: WHAT TRAVELERS HAS DONE — DOCUMENTED VIOLATIONS

Before presenting the settlement terms, it is necessary to place on the record the full scope of Travelers' misconduct. Every statement below is supported by documentary evidence in the Khizver family's possession.

### A. Four Contradictory Explanations for the Same $2,401.67 Payment (JFK4192)

Travelers has provided **four materially different, mutually exclusive explanations** for the misdirection of $2,401.67 intended for Aleksandra Khizver's Mercedes claim. These explanations cannot all be true. At least three are false.

| Date | Travelers Representative | Explanation Given |
|:-----|:------------------------|:------------------|
| August 19, 2025 | **Craig Bottongino**, Adjuster | "Payment issued to account attached to the policy" |
| August 22, 2025 | **Terrynce Bing**, Adjuster | Acknowledged misrouting; promised investigation and referral to supervisor — then never followed up |
| September 10, 2025 | **Karen Ramey**, Claim Manager (CDI Response) | "The insured registered the account via the MyTravelers portal" |
| November 19, 2025 | **Jonathan H. Colman**, Outside Counsel | "Payment was made electronically to the same account from which premium payments were withdrawn" |

Each explanation contradicts the others. Terrynce Bing acknowledged the payment was misrouted. Karen Ramey then blamed the insured. Jonathan Colman invented a new theory linking the account to premium payments. Craig Bottongino's original statement is vague and unverifiable.

**Violation:** Cal. Ins. Code § 790.03(h)(1) — Misrepresenting pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions relating to coverages at issue.

### B. False Date Reported to the California Department of Insurance

Karen Ramey's September 10, 2025 CDI response letter states the payment was made on **"August 12, 2025."** The verified evidence — including Igor Khizver's contemporaneous email to Jack Gunther on August 19, 2025, and Jack Gunther's August 20, 2025 confirmation that payment was "issued electronically" — establishes the payment was processed on **August 19, 2025**, four days after the August 15 inspection.

Providing a false date to the California Department of Insurance is a material misrepresentation to a regulatory agency.

**Violation:** Cal. Ins. Code § 790.03(h)(1) — Misrepresentation to a regulatory body.

### C. Willful Disregard of Notarized Power of Attorney

Aleksandra Khizver executed a written authorization on August 5, 2025, designating her son Igor Khizver as her sole representative. A notarized, durable Power of Attorney was executed on August 21, 2025, and delivered to Travelers.

For 52 days, Travelers communicated exclusively with Igor — operationally accepting his authority. Then, on September 25, 2025, Karen Ramey sent an email — copied to both Igor and Aleksandra — stating the authorization was **"not legally binding for the insurance."** This statement was made 35 days after the notarized POA was already on file.

Karen Ramey's letter to CDI (September 10, 2025) acknowledges the authorization letter but ignores the notarized POA entirely. This was not ignorance; it was willful disregard.

**Violation:** 10 CCR § 2695.7(c)(1) — Failure to communicate with authorized representative; Cal. Civ. Code § 4124 — Disregard of valid Power of Attorney.

### D. Gross Undervaluation and OEM Parts Misrepresentation (JFK4192)

Jack Gunther's August 15, 2025 estimate valued the Mercedes repairs at $2,901.67. Three independent estimates ranged from $5,507.58 to $7,830.84 — a discrepancy of 90% to 170%.

Karen Ramey's CDI response stated: **"The policy does not provide coverage for OEM parts."** This is a misrepresentation. California law — not the policy — governs the use of OEM parts. The 2021 Mercedes-Benz GLA250 had fewer than 20,000 miles at the time of loss. Under California Insurance Code § 758.5 and applicable regulations, OEM parts are required for vehicles of this age and mileage.

**Violation:** 10 CCR § 2695.7(c)(1) — Unreasonably low settlement offer not based on competent evaluation; Cal. Ins. Code § 790.03(h)(5) — Failure to affirm or deny coverage within a reasonable time.

### E. Medical Emergency Caused by Travelers' Conduct

On August 27, 2025 — eight days after the misdirected payment — Aleksandra Khizver was rushed to the Kaiser Permanente Emergency Department with chest pain, shortness of breath, and anxiety. The treating physician, Dr. Ingrid Ting Lim, documented:

> **"States that she is extremely anxious and was upset around 12 today because her new car had a 'check engine' light."**

Mrs. Khizver had undergone cardiac catheterization and stent placement just **40 days earlier** (July 18, 2025). She is a 68-year-old cardiac patient with a family history of heart disease. The stress caused by Travelers' payment misdirection, conflicting information, and refusal to resolve the claim triggered a medical emergency that required emergency department evaluation, cardiac monitoring, and prescription medication (Ativan).

Jonathan Colman's November 19, 2025 letter states: **"Travelers was unaware of any medical issues which might have affected its claims handling."** This is false. Igor Khizver's August 22, 2025 email to Terrynce Bing explicitly referenced his mother's medical condition and the stress caused by the claim.

**Violation:** Cal. W&I Code § 15610.30 — Financial Elder Abuse; Cal. Ins. Code § 790.03(h)(3) — Failing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for prompt investigation.

### F. Prius Total Loss Payment Shortfall and Unreturned Premium (JCM4246001)

Travelers accepted the Prius as a total loss and valued it at $7,563.70. However, $100 of that amount was never paid, despite Igor Khizver's documented request and Tristan Landrum's acknowledgment of the dispute.

Additionally, the Prius was signed off to Travelers in approximately July 2025. The annual premium for the Prius was $1,299.00 (per the policy declarations page). Despite the vehicle being totaled and surrendered, Travelers continued to list the Prius on the policy through December 2025 and never refunded the pro-rated unused premium.

Based on a July 15, 2025 removal date and the December 7, 2025 policy expiration, the unused premium for 145 days is **$516.04**.

**Violation:** Cal. Ins. Code § 790.03(h)(2) — Failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications with respect to claims; 10 CCR § 2695.7(b) — Failure to provide timely and complete settlement.

### G. BMW Claim Delay and Obstruction (JHV3227)

The BMW claim was filed on December 7, 2025. As of February 4, 2026 — 59 days later — Travelers has not issued a coverage determination. Katelyn Atkinson's February 4, 2026 response states only that "Travelers is still undergoing a coverage investigation" without specifying what remains under investigation, what documents are outstanding, or when a determination will be made.

Igor Khizver has complied with every request, including photographs, repair documentation, estimates, a recorded statement, and complete written responses to all questions. There are no outstanding items from the insured.

**Violation:** 10 CCR § 2695.7(b) — Failure to accept or deny claim within 40 days; Cal. Ins. Code § 790.03(h)(3) — Failing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for prompt investigation.

### H. EUO Obstruction and Refusal to Comply with Statutory Obligations

Travelers scheduled an Examination Under Oath for February 3, 2026, through outside counsel Jonathan Colman. Igor Khizver, as authorized representative, requested postponement until Travelers complied with:

1. **Cal. Ins. Code § 2071** — Mandatory tax return privilege notice (never provided)
2. **Cal. Ins. Code § 10082.3** — Production of claim-related documents (never produced)

Jonathan Colman's January 28, 2026 letter stated: **"Other than the Examination Under Oath notice letter sent to you on December 12, 2025, no further explanation will be provided by Travelers prior to the Examination Under Oath."** This is an explicit refusal to comply with California statutory requirements.

Igor Khizver confirmed willingness to appear but noted that proceeding without statutory compliance would be inefficient and legally deficient. Colman's January 30, 2026 response was a one-line email: **"Proceed on February 3 per our letter of January 23."** No substantive response to any of the statutory compliance requests was provided.

**Violation:** Cal. Ins. Code § 2071 — Failure to provide tax return privilege notice; Cal. Ins. Code § 10082.3 — Failure to produce claim file.

| Sept 30, 2025 | — | Ashley Murphy: "additional response for your review" — refers to Karen Ramey — **no resolution** |

**Pattern:** In every instance, the Khizver family initiated communication, complied with requests, and sought resolution. In every instance, Travelers either ignored, deflected, provided contradictory information, or refused to engage substantively.

## SECTION IV: TIME AND RESOURCES INVESTED

Igor Khizver has invested in excess of **300 hours** over the past eight months researching California insurance law, Travelers' claims practices, regulatory requirements, and the specific facts of these three claims. This includes:

- Reviewing and analyzing hundreds of pages of correspondence, estimates, medical records, and policy documents
- Researching California Insurance Code provisions, Fair Claims Settlement Practices Regulations (10 CCR § 2695 et seq.), and relevant case law
- Preparing multiple formal demand letters, certified mail packets, and evidence compilations
- Filing and responding to three California Department of Insurance complaints
- Preparing for and responding to EUO scheduling, postponement requests, and statutory compliance demands
- Researching Travelers' corporate history of bad faith litigation, including *Vann v. Travelers* ($26.5M verdict), *Maxus Properties v. Travelers* ($27M verdict), and the 2006 multi-state $77M settlement

This is not a case where a claimant casually decided to dispute an insurance payment. This is a case where a family — led by a son protecting his 68-year-old cardiac patient mother and his mentally disabled father — has methodically documented every communication, every contradiction, and every violation. The evidence is organized, indexed, and litigation-ready.

---

## SECTION V: SETTLEMENT TERMS

The Khizver family offers to resolve all three claims in a single transaction as follows:

### A. Claim-Specific Amounts

| Claim | Description | Amount |
|:------|:------------|-------:|
| **JFK4192** (Mercedes) | Complete settlement of all repair, misdirected payment, and valuation claims | **$7,500.00** |
| **JCM4246001** (Prius) | $100.00 total loss shortfall + $516.04 pro-rated premium refund (145 days unused at $1,299/year) | **$616.04** |
| **JHV3227** (BMW) | Complete settlement of BMW claim | **$4,500.00** |
| | **Claims Subtotal** | **$12,616.04** |

### B. Prejudgment Interest (Cal. Civ. Code § 3289 — 10% per annum)

| Claim | Principal | Start Date | Days | Interest |
|:------|----------:|:-----------|-----:|---------:|
| JFK4192 | $7,500.00 | Aug 19, 2025 | 177 | $363.70 |
| JCM4246001 | $616.04 | Jul 15, 2025 | 212 | $35.78 |
| JHV3227 | $4,500.00 | Dec 7, 2025 | 67 | $82.60 |
| | | | **Total Interest** | **$482.08** |

| Claims Subtotal | $12,616.04 |

## SECTION VI: WHAT THIS OFFER REPRESENTS

This offer of **$28,098.12** is a fraction of what the Khizver family would seek in litigation. For context:

- **Bad faith damages** under California law are not limited to the policy amount and may include emotional distress, consequential damages, and attorney fees.
- **Punitive damages** are available where the insurer's conduct is oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious. The four contradictory explanations, false CDI reporting, POA disregard, and conduct toward a 68-year-old cardiac patient support a punitive damages claim.
- **Elder abuse damages** under Cal. W&I Code § 15657 include attorney fees, costs, and enhanced remedies.
- **Travelers' litigation exposure** in comparable cases has reached $26.5 million (*Vann v. Travelers*, 1997) and $27 million (*Maxus Properties v. Travelers*, 2024).

This settlement offer asks Travelers to pay **$28,098.12** to resolve three claims, avoid litigation, and close the matter. It is a reasonable, good faith offer that saves Travelers the cost of outside counsel (Colman Perkins' hourly rates alone would exceed this amount within weeks of active litigation), the risk of a jury verdict, and the reputational exposure of another documented bad faith case.

---

## SECTION VII: CONDITIONS

1. **Payment:** $28,098.12 by certified check or wire transfer to an account designated by Igor Khizver, as authorized representative, within 10 business days of acceptance.

2. **Release:** Upon receipt of payment, the Khizver family will execute a mutual release of all claims arising from Claims JFK4192, JCM4246001, and JHV3227, including but not limited to bad faith, breach of contract, elder abuse, and emotional distress claims.

3. **No Admission:** This settlement does not constitute an admission of liability by either party.

4. **Confidentiality:** The terms of this settlement will remain confidential, except as required by law or regulatory obligation.

5. **Prius Removal:** Travelers will immediately remove the 2008 Toyota Prius from the policy and confirm in writing that no further premiums will be charged for that vehicle.

---

## SECTION VIII: DEADLINE AND CONSEQUENCES

**This offer expires at 5:00 PM Pacific Time on Wednesday, February 12, 2026.**

If Travelers does not accept this offer or provide a meaningful written counter-offer by that deadline, the Khizver family will:

1. **File a formal bad faith lawsuit** in the Superior Court of California, County of Contra Costa, seeking compensatory damages, emotional distress damages, punitive damages, and attorney fees.

2. **File an elder abuse complaint** under Cal. W&I Code § 15610.30, seeking enhanced remedies under § 15657.

3. **File additional complaints** with the California Department of Insurance documenting all violations identified in this letter.

4. **Seek class action certification** or join existing actions against Travelers for systemic bad faith claims practices, consistent with the pattern documented in *Vann*, *Maxus*, and the 2006 multi-state settlement.

5. **Make all evidence available** to any attorney, regulatory body, or media outlet investigating Travelers' claims practices, to the extent permitted by law.

---

## SECTION IX: CONCLUSION

The Khizver family has demonstrated extraordinary patience and good faith throughout this process. They have complied with every request, responded to every communication, and documented every interaction. Travelers has responded with misdirected payments, contradictory explanations, false statements to regulators, disregard of legal authority, undervaluation, delay, and obstruction.

This offer gives Travelers one opportunity to resolve this matter efficiently and honorably. The alternative is litigation that will cost Travelers far more — in money, in time, and in the public record of how it treats a 68-year-old cardiac patient and her family.

We look forward to your response.

## KEY FINDING: PAYMENT BEFORE INSPECTION

**This is critical evidence of bad faith:**

1. **August 12, 2025** — Payment of $2,401.67 misdirected to account ending in 2366
2. **August 15, 2025 at 10:27 AM** — Jack Gunther inspects the vehicle at 388 Beale

**The payment was issued THREE DAYS BEFORE the vehicle was even inspected.**

This proves:
- Travelers issued payment before completing their investigation
- The payment amount was not based on an actual inspection
- The estimate was created AFTER the payment was already sent
- This is a procedural violation that demonstrates systemic claims handling failures

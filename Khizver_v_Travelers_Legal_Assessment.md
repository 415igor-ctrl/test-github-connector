## I. FACTS

### A. Parties and Claims

Aleksandra Khizver (age 68) and Iosif Khizver (age 69) are the named insureds under Travelers Commercial Insurance Company Policy No. 6080375032031. Two claims are at issue in this matter.

| Claim Number | Vehicle | Insured | Date of Loss | Status |
|:-------------|:--------|:--------|:-------------|:-------|
| JFK4192 | 2021 Mercedes-Benz GLA250 | Aleksandra Khizver | June 19, 2025 | Disputed |
| JCM4246 | Toyota Prius | Iosif Khizver | May 10, 2025 | Settled/Totaled |

Igor Khizver, the son of both insureds, holds a valid, notarized Durable Power of Attorney dated August 21, 2025, granting him authority to act on behalf of his mother in all insurance matters. A prior Authorization Letter dated August 5, 2025, also designated Igor as the sole representative for claim communications. The mother is a 68-year-old woman who underwent a cardiac stent procedure in July 2025 after a 90% arterial blockage was discovered. The father, Iosif Khizver, has a documented diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, which renders him unable to manage his own financial affairs.

### C. Payment Misdirection

The central factual dispute concerns the misdirection of $2,401.67 on August 12, 2025. The documentary record establishes the following:

The payment was sent to a bank account ending in 2366. Neither Aleksandra Khizver nor Igor Khizver authorized this account. Aleksandra has declared under penalty of perjury that the account is not hers and was never approved by her. Travelers' own representatives have provided contradictory explanations for this payment. Craig Bottongino stated it was sent to the "account on file." Terrynce Bing stated it was a "check mailed to Walnut Creek." The Travelers app reflects a "check to Walnut Creek." Other internal records indicate an "electronic deposit to account 2366."

This account 2366 appears in the records for both the Mercedes claim (JFK4192) and the Prius claim (JCM4246). In the Prius claim file, adjuster Tristan Landrum documented that account 2366 "was not attached" to the policy and "lacked ACH capability." This raises a critical question: how could an account that was "not attached" and "lacked ACH capability" receive an electronic deposit?

The most troubling possibility, raised by the insureds, is that account 2366 belongs to Iosif Khizver, the father. Iosif has a documented history of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and is unable to manage his own financial affairs. If Travelers sent funds to his account without authorization or oversight, this constitutes gross negligence and potential financial elder abuse.

### D. Valuation Discrepancy

The disparity between Travelers' repair estimate and the independent estimates is substantial and cannot be attributed to a good-faith difference of opinion.

| Source | Estimate | Methodology | OEM Parts Included? |
|:-------|:---------|:------------|:--------------------|
| Travelers (Jack Gunther) | $2,901.67 | Internal | **No** |
| USA Auto Body | $5,507.58 | Mitchell | Yes |
| Parkside Paint & Body | $6,231.16 | CCC | Yes |
| Tony's Collision | $7,830.84 | Audatex | Yes |
| **Average Independent** | **$6,523.19** | — | — |
| **Discrepancy** | **+$3,621.52 (+125%)** | — | — |

California law requires the use of OEM parts for vehicles under 20,000 miles. The 2021 Mercedes qualifies. Travelers' estimate deliberately omitted OEM parts, resulting in a systematic undervaluation of 90% to 170%.

### E. Power of Attorney Violations

Despite being provided with a valid Authorization Letter (August 5, 2025) and a notarized Durable Power of Attorney (August 21, 2025), Travelers' employees repeatedly bypassed Igor Khizver and contacted Aleksandra directly.

On September 5, 2025, an unauthorized investigator contacted Aleksandra directly, in violation of the August 5 authorization. On September 18, 2025, investigator Ricky Freyre requested a recorded statement from both Igor and his mother, ignoring the POA. On September 25, 2025, claim handler Karen Ramey sent an email to both Igor and Aleksandra explicitly challenging the validity of the POA, stating it was "not legally binding for the insurance."

This challenge came after 52 days of operational acceptance, during which Travelers communicated exclusively with Igor. The sudden reversal, without any legal basis, appears designed to undermine the insured's representation and to pressure a vulnerable, elderly woman recovering from heart surgery.

### F. Medical Causation

The stress caused by Travelers' conduct has had direct, documented medical consequences for Aleksandra Khizver. On August 27, 2025, five days after Terrynce Bing acknowledged the payment error, Aleksandra was treated in the Kaiser Permanente Emergency Department for chest pain.

> "She reports acute onset of left-sided chest pain with radiation to her back after she experienced **stressful event with her car.**"
> — Kaiser ED Note, Dr. Ingrid Ting Lim, August 27, 2025

On September 3, 2025, her cardiologist, Dr. Jana Svetlichnaya, confirmed the stress causation in a follow-up telephone call. This medical documentation establishes a direct causal link between Travelers' conduct and physical harm to the insured.

## II. ISSUES

1.  Did Travelers breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing through its pattern of unreasonable delay, payment misdirection, and failure to investigate?
2.  Does the systematic undervaluation of the repair estimate, evidenced by a 90-170% discrepancy with three independent estimates, constitute an unfair claims settlement practice?
3.  Did Travelers engage in bad faith by willfully disregarding a valid Power of Attorney and communicating directly with a vulnerable, elderly insured?
4.  Does the demand for an EUO, following a bad faith complaint and accompanied by overly broad document requests, constitute unlawful retaliation or procedural harassment?
5.  Does Travelers' conduct give rise to a claim for financial elder abuse under the California Welfare and Institutions Code?

---

## III. GOVERNING LAW

### A. Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing

Every insurance contract in California contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. This covenant requires that neither party do anything which will injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement. An insurer's breach of this covenant gives rise to a cause of action for insurance bad faith.

### B. California Insurance Code § 790.03(h) — Unfair Claims Settlement Practices

This section defines the following as unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts or practices:

| Subsection | Prohibited Conduct |
|:-----------|:-------------------|
| (h)(1) | Knowingly misrepresenting pertinent facts or policy provisions. |
| (h)(2) | Failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications. |
| (h)(3) | Failing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for prompt investigation and processing of claims. |
| (h)(5) | Not attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements where liability is reasonably clear. |
| (h)(13) | Failing to provide a reasonable explanation for denial or compromise settlement. |

### C. California Code of Regulations, Title 10, Chapter 5, Subchapter 7.5

| Section | Requirement |
|:--------|:------------|
| § 2695.5(b) | Acknowledge receipt of claim within 15 calendar days. |
| § 2695.5(e) | Reply to communications reasonably suggesting a response within 15 calendar days. |
| § 2695.7(c)(1) | No insurer shall make an unreasonably low settlement offer. |
| § 2695.7(g) | No insurer shall knowingly misrepresent policy provisions. |

### D. California Insurance Code § 2071 — Tax Return Privilege Notice

This statute requires that before demanding tax returns, an insurer must provide written notice advising that tax returns are privileged against disclosure but may be necessary to process the claim. Travelers' EUO demand included a request for tax returns without this required notice.

### E. California Insurance Code § 10082.3 — Claim-Related Document Production

Upon request by a first-party claimant, an insurer must produce all documents "relating to the evaluation and handling of the claim." Any documents withheld on the basis of privilege must be identified in a privilege log.

### F. California Welfare and Institutions Code § 15610.30 — Financial Elder Abuse

Financial abuse of an elder occurs when a person or entity takes or assists in taking property from an elder with intent to defraud, or by undue influence, or when a person or entity fails to return property of an elder when obligated to do so. Enhanced remedies, including treble damages and mandatory attorney's fees, are available.

## IV. ANALYSIS

### A. Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing

Travelers' actions, viewed in their totality, constitute a clear breach of the implied covenant. The misdirection of funds to an unauthorized account, the refusal to correct the error despite a written admission, the systematic undervaluation of the claim, and the willful disregard of the POA all contribute to a finding of bad faith.

The promise of a banking investigation by Terrynce Bing on August 22, 2025, which was never acted upon, is particularly damning. This failure to follow through on a promise to correct an admitted error is a hallmark of bad faith. The subsequent withdrawal of Bing from the claim on September 12, 2025, without resolution, further demonstrates a pattern of abandonment and delay.

### B. Unfair Claims Settlement Practices

Travelers has engaged in multiple prohibited practices under California Insurance Code § 790.03(h):

**Misrepresentation (§ 790.03(h)(1)):** Travelers' representatives provided conflicting and irreconcilable stories about the misdirected payment. One claimed it was an electronic transfer; another claimed it was a mailed check. The Travelers app shows a check. Internal records show an electronic deposit. These contradictions are not mere errors; they are evidence of a systemic failure to maintain accurate records, or worse, an attempt to obfuscate the truth.

**Failure to Acknowledge Communications (§ 790.03(h)(2)):** The formal escalation sent on August 29, 2025, received only an auto-reply. No human acknowledgment followed. Multiple subsequent communications were similarly ignored.

**Failure to Investigate (§ 790.03(h)(3)):** The promised banking investigation never occurred. The payment misdirection was acknowledged but never corrected.

**Failure to Settle (§ 790.03(h)(5)):** The 90-170% undervaluation of the claim, supported by three independent estimates using three different industry-standard systems, demonstrates a failure to attempt a fair settlement. Liability for the underlying loss is not in dispute; only the valuation is at issue. The deliberate omission of OEM parts, required by California law, is evidence of a knowing and intentional effort to underpay the claim.

### C. Willful Disregard of Power of Attorney

The refusal to honor the POA is a serious breach. By contacting Ms. Khizver directly, Travelers and its agents created unnecessary stress, which is medically documented to have resulted in a visit to the emergency room. This conduct, directed at a vulnerable 68-year-old recovering from heart surgery, is not only bad faith but also potentially constitutes financial elder abuse.

Karen Ramey's email of September 25, 2025, explicitly challenging the validity of a notarized POA, is without legal basis. A durable power of attorney, properly executed and notarized under California law, is valid and binding. Travelers' claim that it is "not legally binding for the insurance" is a misrepresentation of the law and an attempt to intimidate the insured.

### D. Retaliatory EUO and Procedural Harassment

The timing and scope of the EUO demand are highly suspect. The demand was issued on October 23, 2025, shortly after Igor Khizver submitted a comprehensive bad faith complaint. This temporal proximity creates a strong inference of retaliation.

The document requests accompanying the EUO demand are overly broad, intrusive, and in many cases, not relevant to the claim. Demanding five years of financial records, social media posts, and tax returns for a straightforward automobile damage claim is disproportionate. The demand for tax returns without the required statutory notice under California Insurance Code § 2071 is a procedural violation.

The entire EUO process appears designed to harass and intimidate the insureds rather than to gather information relevant to the claim. This is a misuse of the EUO process and further evidence of bad faith.

### E. Financial Elder Abuse

Travelers' conduct may give rise to a claim for financial elder abuse under California Welfare and Institutions Code § 15610.30. The elements are present:

1.  **Taking of Property:** Travelers misdirected $2,401.67 to an unauthorized account and has failed to return it.
2.  **Elder Victim:** Aleksandra Khizver is 68 years old.
3.  **Intent or Negligence:** The conflicting explanations, the failure to investigate, and the potential routing of funds to an account belonging to a mentally disabled family member suggest, at minimum, gross negligence.
4.  **Harm:** The insured has suffered financial harm (loss of funds) and physical harm (ER visit for stress-induced chest pain).

If proven, elder abuse carries enhanced remedies, including treble damages and mandatory attorney's fees.

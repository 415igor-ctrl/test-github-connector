## I. FACTS

### A. Parties and Claims

Aleksandra Khizver (age 68) and Iosif Khizver (age 69) are the named insureds under Travelers Commercial Insurance Company Policy No. 6080375032031. Two claims are at issue in this matter.

| Claim Number | Vehicle | Insured | Date of Loss | Status |
|:-------------|:--------|:--------|:-------------|:-------|
| JFK4192 | 2021 Mercedes-Benz GLA250 | Aleksandra Khizver | June 19, 2025 | Disputed |
| JCM4246 | Toyota Prius | Iosif Khizver | May 10, 2025 | Settled/Totaled |

Igor Khizver, the son of both insureds, holds a valid, notarized Durable Power of Attorney dated August 21, 2025, granting him authority to act on behalf of his mother in all insurance matters. A prior Authorization Letter dated August 5, 2025, also designated Igor as the sole representative for claim communications. The mother is a 68-year-old woman who underwent a cardiac stent procedure in July 2025 after a 90% arterial blockage was discovered. The father, Iosif Khizver, has a documented diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, which renders him unable to manage his own financial affairs.

### C. Payment Before Inspection: A Fundamental Breach

The corrected timeline reveals a critical and undeniable breach of good faith: Travelers issued payment **before** conducting a reasonable investigation. 

1.  **August 12, 2025**: Payment of $2,401.67 is misdirected to an unauthorized account.
2.  **August 15, 2025**: Jack Gunther inspects the vehicle.

This sequence proves that the payment was not based on an actual assessment of the damage. It is a fundamental violation of an insurer's duty to investigate claims fairly and thoroughly before making payment decisions. This is not a clerical error; it is a procedural failure that undermines the integrity of the entire claims process.

### D. The Four Contradictory Explanations for Payment Misdirection

The bad faith is compounded by the series of four distinct, contradictory, and irreconcilable explanations provided by Travelers for the misdirected payment:

| Date | Source | Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| August 19, 2025 | Craig Bottongino (Adjuster) | Payment was issued to the "account attached to policy." |
| August 22, 2025 | Terrynce Bing (Adjuster) | Acknowledged misrouting and promised an investigation that never occurred. |
| September 10, 2025 | Karen Ramey (Claim Manager) | The insured registered the unauthorized account herself via the MyTravelers portal. |
| November 19, 2025 | Jonathan Colman (Outside Counsel) | Payment was made to the "same account from which premium payments were withdrawn." |

This pattern of shifting explanations is not merely negligent; it is strong evidence of a conscious effort to conceal the truth and avoid responsibility. The explanations are mutually exclusive. The insured could not have registered an account that was also the premium payment account and also an account that was acknowledged as a misrouting. This conduct goes to the heart of a bad faith claim, demonstrating a failure to conduct a fair and objective investigation and a willingness to misrepresent facts to the insured and to a regulatory body (the CDI).

### E. Willful Disregard of Power of Attorney

Despite being provided with a valid Authorization Letter (August 5, 2025) and a notarized Durable Power of Attorney (August 21, 2025), Travelers’ employees repeatedly bypassed Igor Khizver and contacted Aleksandra directly. Karen Ramey’s September 10, 2025, letter to the CDI acknowledges the authorization but dismisses it as not an official POA, completely ignoring the actual notarized POA that had been on file for 20 days. This proves the disregard was willful.

### F. Misrepresentation of California Law

In her September 10, 2025, letter to the CDI, Claim Manager Karen Ramey explicitly states, "The policy does not provide coverage for OEM parts." This is a direct misrepresentation of California law, which requires the use of OEM parts for vehicles under 20,000 miles. Travelers cannot contract around this statutory requirement.

### G. Medical Causation

The stress caused by Travelers’ conduct has had direct, documented medical consequences for Aleksandra Khizver. On August 27, 2025, five days after Terrynce Bing acknowledged the payment error, Aleksandra was treated in the Kaiser Permanente Emergency Department for chest pain.

> "She reports acute onset of left-sided chest pain with radiation to her back after she experienced **stressful event with her car.**"
> — Kaiser ED Note, Dr. Ingrid Ting Lim, August 27, 2025

On September 3, 2025, her cardiologist, Dr. Jana Svetlichnaya, confirmed the stress causation in a follow-up telephone call. This medical documentation establishes a direct causal link between Travelers’ conduct and physical harm to the insured.

## II. ISSUES

1.  Did Travelers breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing through its pattern of unreasonable delay, payment misdirection, and failure to investigate?
2.  Does the systematic undervaluation of the repair estimate, evidenced by a 90-170% discrepancy with three independent estimates, constitute an unfair claims settlement practice?
3.  Did Travelers engage in bad faith by willfully disregarding a valid Power of Attorney and communicating directly with a vulnerable, elderly insured?
4.  Does the demand for an EUO, following a bad faith complaint and accompanied by overly broad document requests, constitute unlawful retaliation or procedural harassment?
5.  Does Travelers’ conduct give rise to a claim for financial elder abuse under the California Welfare and Institutions Code?

---

## III. GOVERNING LAW

### A. Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing

Every insurance contract in California contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. This covenant requires that neither party do anything which will injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement. An insurer’s breach of this covenant gives rise to a cause of action for insurance bad faith.

### B. California Insurance Code § 790.03(h) — Unfair Claims Settlement Practices

This section defines the following as unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts or practices:

| Subsection | Prohibited Conduct |
|:-----------|:-------------------|
| (h)(1) | Knowingly misrepresenting pertinent facts or policy provisions. |
| (h)(2) | Failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications. |
| (h)(3) | Failing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for prompt investigation and processing of claims. |
| (h)(5) | Not attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements where liability is reasonably clear. |
| (h)(13) | Failing to provide a reasonable explanation for denial or compromise settlement. |

### C. California Code of Regulations, Title 10, Chapter 5, Subchapter 7.5

| Section | Requirement |
|:--------|:------------|
| § 2695.5(b) | Acknowledge receipt of claim within 15 calendar days. |
| § 2695.5(e) | Reply to communications reasonably suggesting a response within 15 calendar days. |
| § 2695.7(c)(1) | No insurer shall make an unreasonably low settlement offer. |
| § 2695.7(g) | No insurer shall knowingly misrepresent policy provisions. |

### D. California Insurance Code § 2071 — Tax Return Privilege Notice

This statute requires that before demanding tax returns, an insurer must provide written notice advising that tax returns are privileged against disclosure but may be necessary to process the claim. Travelers’ EUO demand included a request for tax returns without this required notice.

### E. California Insurance Code § 10082.3 — Claim-Related Document Production

Upon request by a first-party claimant, an insurer must produce all documents "relating to the evaluation and handling of the claim." Any documents withheld on the basis of privilege must be identified in a privilege log.

### F. California Welfare and Institutions Code § 15610.30 — Financial Elder Abuse

Financial abuse of an elder occurs when a person or entity takes or assists in taking property from an elder with intent to defraud, or by undue influence, or when a person or entity fails to return property of an elder when obligated to do so. Enhanced remedies, including treble damages and mandatory attorney’s fees, are available.

## IV. ANALYSIS

### A. Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing

Travelers’ actions, viewed in their totality, constitute a clear breach of the implied covenant. The payment before inspection, the four contradictory explanations for the misdirected payment, the refusal to correct the error, the systematic undervaluation of the claim, and the willful disregard of the POA all contribute to a finding of bad faith.

The pattern of conduct in this case mirrors the pattern of "Deny, Delay, Defend" identified in the analysis of Travelers’ corporate history, including the landmark California bad faith case, *Vann v. The Travelers Insurance Company*.

### B. Unfair Claims Settlement Practices

Travelers has engaged in multiple prohibited practices under California Insurance Code § 790.03(h):

**Misrepresentation (§ 790.03(h)(1)):** The four contradictory explanations for the misdirected payment constitute a pattern of knowing misrepresentation. Furthermore, Karen Ramey’s statement to the CDI that "The policy does not provide coverage for OEM parts" is a direct misrepresentation of the law.

**Failure to Investigate (§ 790.03(h)(3)):** The payment before inspection is prima facie evidence of a failure to investigate. The promised banking investigation never occurred. The existence of four different internal explanations for the same payment proves that no reasonable investigation was ever conducted.

**Failure to Settle (§ 790.03(h)(5)):** The 90-170% undervaluation of the claim, supported by three independent estimates, demonstrates a failure to attempt a fair settlement where liability is clear.

### C. Willful Disregard of Power of Attorney

The new evidence from Karen Ramey’s September 10, 2025, letter to the CDI strengthens this claim. By acknowledging the authorization letter but ignoring the notarized POA that had been on file for 20 days, Travelers demonstrated that its disregard was not an oversight but a willful act.

### D. Retaliatory EUO and Procedural Harassment

The timing and scope of the EUO demand, immediately following a bad faith complaint, create a strong inference of retaliation. The demand is procedurally deficient, failing to provide the required statutory notice regarding tax returns (**Ins. Code § 2071**). The breadth of the document requests is unreasonable and appears calculated to harass and intimidate the insureds rather than to gather information relevant to the claim.

### E. Financial Elder Abuse

Travelers’ conduct may give rise to a claim for financial elder abuse under California Welfare and Institutions Code § 15610.30. The elements are present:

1.  **Taking of Property:** Travelers misdirected $2,401.67 to an unauthorized account and has failed to return it.
2.  **Elder Victim:** Aleksandra Khizver is 68 years old.
3.  **Intent or Negligence:** The payment before inspection, the four contradictory explanations, the failure to investigate, and the potential routing of funds to an account belonging to a mentally disabled family member suggest, at minimum, gross negligence and a reckless disregard for the insured’s rights.
4.  **Harm:** The insured has suffered financial harm (loss of funds) and physical harm (ER visit for stress-induced chest pain).
